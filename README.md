# 2D Pyroclast Impact Detection and Evacuation Simulation in Matlab

## Description

This repository contains a Matlab project that implements a 2D simulation to calculate the areas that may be affected by the release of pyroclasts from an erupting volcano. The aim of the simulation is to detect danger zones of possible impacts and be able to evacuate the population on time within these zones. The simulation uses Verlet's numeric system to predict and calculate the position of the pyroclasts.

## Features

- Calculation of areas that may be affected by pyroclast release.
- Detection of danger zones of possible impacts.
- Evacuation simulation for the population within danger zones.
- Use of Verlet's numeric system to predict and calculate pyroclast position.
- Implementation in Matlab.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Matlab R2021 or higher installed. You can then clone the repository and run the [SimulacionVolcan.m](./SimulacionVolcan.m) file in Matlab.
